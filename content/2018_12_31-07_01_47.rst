For some reason I decided to start reading `Cracking the Coding Interview <https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X>`_. It suggests you know certain algorithms and data structures by heart. Now, I do remember all of these, however I have not implemented most of these in modern times using 'modern' languages.

So here it is my first try at implementing a `binary search tree <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree>`_ in Python. Enjoy.
