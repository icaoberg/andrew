:summary: Macs are better... :(

I feel kind of sad. My first desktop was a PC running Windows 95 and for many years I kept using Windows at home.

Today, my Windows PC died. I have a Mac at home. I considered buying or rebuilding the machine with spare parts because I have an old laser printer which, according to the docs, only works on Windows.

As I was struggling to come with a feasible solution that would appease my zero-waste soul, I decided to connect the printer to the Mac. I mean, it took me like 2 hours to install the same printer on Windows (it is a super old printer), I figured if I spent less than 3 hours installing it would worth it.

MacOSX recognized it inmediately and printed what I needed to print. No more Windows at home. It is, what it is.
