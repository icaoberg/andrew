Spanish II is geared toward those who already have a basic understanding of Spanish and are interested in increasing proficiency.

We meet today at 6:30p.m. in the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh Main (Oakland) Classroom A. I will be leading these classes with other members of the community.

* These classes are FREE.
* You do not have to register for the classes.
* You do not need to bring anything or buy anything.
* New participants are welcome at any time.

This class is for adults, but young people are welcome as long as they behave respectfully.
