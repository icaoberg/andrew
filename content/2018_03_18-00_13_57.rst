I have been struggling trying to install Galaxy and the CellOrganizer tools in the same container. It seems like `Docker compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_ will be the solution to my problem. However I need to figure out what is the best way to have the first container talked to the second, since the tools were not created to communicated outside of their environment/workspace.
