The word cloud above was generated using scholarcloud. Scholarcloud is nothing but a simple script that generates a wordcloud from different scholarly resources.

This code is super-alpha. I am still testing other python packages that can I piece together so that I do not have reinvent the wheel. If everything works as planned, scholarcloud will be nothing but wrapper around existing tools.
