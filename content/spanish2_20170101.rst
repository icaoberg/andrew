The books I am using for `Spanish II <http://www.carnegielibrary.org/?s=spanish+ii&search-location=Website>`_ and in the `Pittsburgh Spanish Meetup Group <https://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Spanish/>`_ are available in the `Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh <https://www.carnegielibrary.org/>`_ network.

This is one of my favorite books, the topics are ridiculous.
