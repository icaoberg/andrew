A few months ago before the elections in Argentina I was watching a TV show called `Bendita TV <https://www.youtube.com/user/benditac9>`_. Some of the panelists from the show were using universal quantifiers to describe Twitter trends, so I got curious. 

Are some of these local trends from Argentina really global? Or is it just an exaggeration?
